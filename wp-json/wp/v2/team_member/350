From a young age, she knew that she wanted to work with animals and discovered her passion for vet nursing shortly after completing University. For many years Maddi considered herself a \u2018dog person\u2019 but had a change of heart after adopting an adorable cat called Lexi from Maneki Neko Cat Rescue. Outside of work, Maddi loves all things music, whether it\u2019s playing guitar, piano or attempting something new like the harmonica or ukulele, it&#8217;s also one of her lifelong passions.
