She first started with us part-time in 2015 while she was completing her certificate IV in Vet Nursing. They say that only 2% of the population can effectively multitask, well, we think Brooklyn falls into this category!\u00a0Her amazing work ethic and attention to detail has kept our\u00a0hospital running smoothly all whilst furthering her study with a Bachelor of Biological Science at LaTrobe part-time. She brings this knowledge and her leadership skills along with an incredible care for animals to our clinic. We are very lucky to have her!<\/p>\n<p>Brooklyn has five furry family members: Wrenley the GSP (who frequents the clinic a few times per week), Jasper the Maltese, Dobby the Kelpie and two rabbits- Bullwinkle and Princess Snow. In her spare time, she plays competition basketball and enjoys taking her three dogs for an uncoordinated run.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":341,"template":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/dev.ivanhoeeastvet.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team_member\/117"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/dev.ivanhoeeastvet.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team_member"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/dev.ivanhoeeastvet.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team_member"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/dev.ivanhoeeastvet.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/341"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/dev.ivanhoeeastvet.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=117"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
