We take on these orphan kittens to help with the rehoming process. You can often see these sweet little fur babies playing on the kitten tower in our front window. The adoption fee covers desexing, microchipping, vaccination and heart and worm treatment all done at cost price. #adoptdontshop<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\t<a href=\"#\" title=\"Afer Hours Emergency Vet\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\tAfer Hours Emergency Vet\n\t\t<\/a>\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>Because our companions can get into serious trouble any time of the day or night we provide an after-hours &#8216;on-call&#8217; emergency service.

Their dedication, attention to detail and care for us as well as snickers went above and beyond what you could only hope for. We will be forever greatful to you all for saving our affectionate and somewhat cheeky rascal! A huge heartfelt thanks once again!<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Sarah<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Dr Rob is great, gives my highly strung dufus dog all the time he needs to get through our visits and explains things really well to me. The nurses are really sweet and friendly. We always feel really supported after visits here, especially compared to some vets. That\u2019s the reason I drive all the way from Croydon rather than taking my babies to the vets in my area.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Jennifer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thanks so much for seeing our collapsed chicken last night. Cinnamon is doing really much better today. Thanks so much for the personalised care, calmness, understanding and also great sense of humor during our visit. Will definitely be switching to your clinic to care for our animal family. Thanks again and highly recommend to all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Dee<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We have the most gorgeous divine Ragdoll cat Ellie Grace who has a life threatening parasite. Rob is amazing &amp; so caring. He even phoned me on his day off to give me an update on her results as he knew we would be anxious. He is the best vet doctor &amp; we highly recommend him to all you animal lovers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Clare<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Best vet clinic ever.

Dr Rob and the staff are incredibly caring, gentle and warm. They ensure that your beloved pet is as comfortable as possible in what can sometimes be a stressful situation. The 24hr emergency service is invaluable! It was such a comfort to have access to the vet outside of business hours when our dog was showing some worrying symptoms. Thank you, Ivanhoe East Veterinary Hospital!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Jenny<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We at Forever Friends Animal Rescue cannot recommend Ivanhoe East Vet Hospital highly enough. Dr Rob, Karrie and all the staff are incredibly dedicated and caring towards our rescue animals, and treat them equally to their other patients. All our volunteers love visiting this clinic and are hugely grateful for the care they give.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Forever Friends Animal Rescue<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We take our dogs to this vet even though it is several suburbs away. I went to a closer vet yesterday morning because I was short of time and got sub standard care. I was worried about my dog\u2019s worsening health as evening came on and Rob at Ivanhoe East took my call and gave us an after hours appointment with excellent care that cost less than the treatment at our closest vet that morning. I have always had great care from Ivanhoe East veterinary hospital from Rob and the locum vets that are there when he is away. I am medically literate as I am a health care professional myself and I cannot recommend them highly enough<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Elizabeth<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>With all my animals I am known on a first name basis! I went to Rob one day when I broke a vial of insulin on the weekend and my vet didn&#8217;t have any. He gave me enough for 3 days, in measured syringes, and didn&#8217;t charge me for it. That was 3 years ago and since then he has looked after my 3 dogs and 20 year old cat. The team has seen me through all kinds of emergencies and a death, and at all times have been thoughtful, caring and professional. I have called at the oddest and most inconvenient of times and have never been turned away. Once, as I entered with my one year old dog on a leash, she became spooked by a truck rushing past and ran straight across the busy road and up a side street at full pelt. Within 10 seconds, Rob and the vet nurse were in hot pursuit. Eventually she was stopped and we all went panting back to the surgery. That&#8217;s dedication! I have recommended many people take their animals there and all have become dedicated patients. At our local park, Rob and his staff are well known and respected. Do yourself a favour; if you have an animal in need of care, take them to East Ivanhoe Vet. ( Also, they don&#8217;t overcharge!)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class='uabb-testimonial-author-name testimonial-author-name'>Lisa<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Compassionate Care for your Companion 7 Days a Week BOOK NOW Our Special Veterinary Services Complimentary Dental Check Regular dental checks are important for the prevention and treatment of dental disease and oral health issues for both dogs and cats.
