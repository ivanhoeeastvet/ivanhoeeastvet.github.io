VACCINATIONS <\/strong><br \/>\nYour puppy requires a 6 week, 10 week and 14-16 week vaccination. This is to protect them against fatal viral infections.<br \/>\n<strong>2. MICROCHIPPING <\/strong><br \/>\nThis is the only permanent identification which links your puppy to you. It is required before registering with the council.<br \/>\n<strong>3. DESEXING <\/strong><br \/>\nPerformed between 6-12 months of age. This will help prevent unwanted behaviours such as roaming, urine marking, inter-dog aggression, mounting etc. It will also prevent health problems such as breast cancer, infected uterus, prostate enlargement, testicular cancer etc.<br \/>\nIf you let a female go through her first heat\u2013 you will increase her risk of breast cancer by nearly 20%.<br \/>\n<strong>4. PARASITE CONTROL<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are 3 parasites you need to protect your puppy against in Melbourne:<br \/>\n<strong>INTESTINAL WORMS:<\/strong> Also common. Life-threatening in high burdens and young puppies.<br \/>\nWorming every 2 weeks until 3 months old, then monthly until 6 months old, then every 3 months for life.<br \/>\n<strong>HEARTWORM:<\/strong> Least common but most life-threatening. Will cause heart failure and many animals don\u2019t survive the treatment. Requires a yearly injection or in some monthly products.<br \/>\n <strong>FLEAS:<\/strong> Most common parasite in Melbourne.<br \/>\nMany animals that come to us have fleas- most of the time the owner is unaware.<br \/>\nBurdens are difficult to eradicate. Each flea can lay up to 300 eggs and each egg can survive for up to 6 months.  Requires a monthly tablet (i.e. Nexgard spectra or Bravecto) or \u201csqueeze- on\u201d (i.e. Advocate or Bravecto). \n<p><strong> IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS, TIPS &#038; HINTS <\/strong><\/p>\n<strong>PET INSURANCE<\/strong><br \/>\nWe strongly recommend pet insurance as: 75% of insured owners make a claim within the first 2 years AND 1\/3 of all pets require costly emergency trip each year. \n<strong> DIET <\/strong><br \/>\nSmall\/medium breeds should be fed puppy food until 12 months of age.<br \/>\nLarger breeds should be fed puppy food until 12-15months of age.<br \/>\nGiant breeds should be fed puppy food until 1.5-2yrs of age. \nWhat should I feed my puppy?<br \/>\nInitially we recommend a fully balanced commercial dry and wet puppy food.<br \/>\nWhen they reach 6-12 months you can offer a variety of foods as long as the daily calorie intake is approximately the same (i.e. reduce the dry food if offering boiled chicken and rice etc). Feed a good quality \u201ccomplete and balanced\u201d puppy dry food. We recommend Royal Canin or Hills Science.<br \/>\nFeed x3 meals per day until your puppy reaches 4 months of age, then reduce to twice daily. \n    \t<strong>DO NOT FEED <\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022\tOnions and garlic<br \/>\n\u2022\tChocolate products<br \/>\n\u2022\tCoffee products<br \/>\n\u2022\tGrapes\/raisins<br \/>\n\u2022\tSugar-free products (gum, ice cream etc)<br \/>\n\u2022\tCompost items (pips- avocado, stone fruit) and corn cobs etc.<br \/>\n\u2022\tFatty food (sausages, pork chops, bbq products)<br \/>\n\u2022\tCooked and raw bones<br \/>\n\u2022\tRaw meat (introduces pathogenic bacteria and parasites into the household).\n<p><strong>DO NOT ALLOW ACCESS TO<\/strong> rat sack, antifreeze, cleaning chemicals, garbage, medications. <\/p>\n<strong> MENTAL &#038; PHYSICAL STIMULATION<\/strong><br \/>\nDogs are high maintenance and they require lots of physical and mental stimulation. \n<strong>TOYS <\/strong><br \/>\nYour puppy is a born chewer! This behaviour needs to be redirected towards toys.<br \/>\n\u2022\tFood Toys: Feed entire meals out of food toys, this will enrich your dog&#8217;s environment and help to make him less destructive. We recommend Kong chew toys and Kong Wobblers as providing great entertainment.<br \/>\n\u2022\tPlay Toys: Must be durable with no choking hazards.<br \/>\n\u2022\tEdible Toys: Vegetable-based chews are safer from bacterial contamination and choking hazards. Eg: Veggie pig\u2019s ears, Greenie\u2019s and Kazoo chews.\n<strong>WALKS\/ RUNNING OFF LEAD <\/strong><br \/>\nDaily walks at walking pace with lots of time to stop and sniff.<br \/>\nOff lead running is very important as it is the best way to expend energy\n<strong> PLAY <\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022\tAlways allow plenty of time to play with your puppy.\u2028<br \/>\n\u2022\tThrowing the ball<br \/>\n\u2022\t\u201cKibble hunting\u201d- throwing kibble in the grass in the back yard and watching your puppy hunt it down<br \/>\n\u2022\t\u2019Hide + seek\u2019: sit your puppy in one room (may need someone to hold the collar) whilst you hide in another room. Then let your puppy use its nose and talent to track you down!\u2028<br \/>\n\u2022\tAvoid or stop play that creates an over excited state of nipping and biting.  \n<strong> DESENSITISING <\/strong><br \/>\nGently get your puppy used to having their paws touched, mouth handled, exposure to water and being brushed. Handling your puppy early allows them to enjoy this process. You never know when you&#8217;re gong to have to regularly bath your puppy or brush its teeth! \n<strong> TRAINING <\/strong><br \/>\nThe best form of mental stimulation!<br \/>\nBasic tricks such as sit, stay, leave, shake hands can all be started before puppy school &#038; should involve lots of positive reinforcement if your puppy does the right thing.<br \/>\nThis involves patience &#8211; do not get frustrated if your puppy doesn\u2019t sit within 5 minutes.<br \/>\nOnce they have mastered the basics, why not try more exciting training such as \u201cclicker training\u201d.  \n<strong> SOCIALISATION <\/strong><br \/>\nPuppies require frequent positive and long term interaction and exposure to greater world experiences in order to become well-rounded adults. \n<p>Home and family: Dogs are social animals thus the most important form of socialisation is family. Puppies should be part of the family and be around the family as much as possible, but must also learn to spend time by themselves. <\/p>\n<p>Other dogs: Early socialisation with friends\u2019 dogs (who are fully vaccinated) is an excellent playdate from the second vaccination. After this they can attend puppy school, doggy day care and mix with friends, family and neighbours dogs.  <\/p>\n<p>After the third vaccination they can socialise at the local park, be taken on errands around town etc. <\/p>\nCan I take my puppy out before his vaccinations are complete?<br \/>\nIt is vital to have a balanced approach to socialisation and disease prevention by providing your puppy with real-world experiences safely. \n<p>You can: <\/p>\n\u2022\tTake your puppy for car rides so he can see, hear and smell the world.<br \/>\n\u2022\tTake your puppy to friends houses and invite friends to your home to meet the puppy.<br \/>\n\u2022\tAttend a reputable puppy school.<br \/>\n\u2022\tSit in your driveway or front yard with your puppy so he can watch the world.<br \/>\n\u2022\tFind as many healthy, calm older dogs for your puppy to meet as possible.<br \/>\n\u2022\tPositive experiences with dogs, people and objects must continue for the first three years of life.\n<p><strong> BASIC TRAINING<\/strong> Before puppy school, there are some behaviours you want to control early.<\/p>\n<strong> TOILET TRAINING<\/strong><br \/>\nThis can take up to 4 months of age for your puppy to get it right- patience, consistency and lots of praise are key.\u2028<br \/>\n1. Initially keep your puppy in a confined area that is easy to clean (i.e. laundry, bathroom, kitchen), preferably near the back door. During the day keep your puppy within eyesight as much as possible (if they\u2019re not within eyesight, they can\u2019t be trained).<br \/>\n2. Take your puppy out every 2 hours initially to the grass, especially after meals or drinking.<br \/>\n3. When they go to the toilet in the right area give lots of praise and treats.<br \/>\n4. When inside, watch for suspicious sniffing in corners &#8211; take them quickly outside.\u2028<br \/>\n5. Try not to give negative reinforcement initially.  If your puppy does toilet inside, it&#8217;s ok to provide mild corrective reinforcement if you catch them in the act, this involves a clap of the hands and a \u201cNO\u201d whilst they are squatting, followed by quick transition outdoors with praise and treats so your puppy understands this is where they are supposed to go.\u2028<br \/>\n6. If you are too late and see your puppy walking away from their \u201cbusiness\u201d, just clean it up and continue to monitor. DON\u2019T scold your puppy or rub their noses in it, they won\u2019t understand why they are being punished. \n<strong> MOUTHING <\/strong><br \/>\nYour puppy lacks impulse control and can easily become carried away with play by mouthing\/biting your hands. Puppies explore their world through their mouths.\u2028<br \/>\n1. If you play with your hand, you can&#8217;t punish your puppy for biting your hands- they have nothing else to play with!!!<br \/>\n2. Always redirect their biting to a toy or rope. Make sure you play with a toy so they learn to grab the toy and not human skin.\u2028<br \/>\n3. If your puppy does mouth or bites your hands- gently say \u201cNO\u201d or &#8220;OUCH&#8221; and encourage play with a toy.<br \/>\n4. If your puppy continues to mouth and bite your hands, follow the second rule: Stop play and walk away.<br \/>\n5. If they become an &#8220;ankle biter&#8221; and follow you around, follow the \u201cTeeth = timeout\u201d rule. Place them in a \u201ctimeout\u201d room like the laundry with no toys for 3 minutes until they calm down.<br \/>\n4. Be patient and consistent. \n<strong> PUPPY SCHOOL<\/strong><br \/>\nThe most common reason for a family surrendering their dog to the pound is bad behaviour.<br \/>\nStarting puppy school early to start the socialising and training process very important.<br \/>\nLearning does not finish with puppy school, continue training and socialisation with your dog to give them the best chance to thrive. Your puppy\u2019s happiness depends on it.\u2028<br \/>\nWe recommend The Kintala Club. \n<p><strong>IVANHOE EAST VETERINARY HOSPITAL &#8211; OPEN 7 DAYS &#8211; \u2028Ph: 9497 3003 Address: 257 Lower Heidelberg Road, IVANHOE EAST, 3079. <\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ivanhoeeastvet.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/IMG_4410-scaled-e1598359402899.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4410\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"1564\" width=\"1685\" title=\"IMG_4410\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Puppy Care at Home So you have a new puppy, or perhaps you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s involved before you take the plunge!
