VACCINATIONS <\/strong><br \/>\nYour puppy requires a 6 week, 10 week and 14-16 week vaccination. This is to protect them against fatal viral infections.<br \/>\n<strong>2. MICROCHIPPING <\/strong><br \/>\nThis is the only permanent identification which links your puppy to you. It is required before registering with the council.<br \/>\n<strong>3. DESEXING <\/strong><br \/>\nPerformed between 6-12 months of age. This will help prevent unwanted behaviours such as roaming, urine marking, inter-dog aggression, mounting etc. It will also prevent health problems such as breast cancer, infected uterus, prostate enlargement, testicular cancer etc.<br \/>\nIf you let a female go through her first heat\u2013 you will increase her risk of breast cancer by nearly 20%.<br \/>\n<strong>4. PARASITE CONTROL<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are 3 parasites you need to protect your puppy against in Melbourne:<br \/>\n<strong>INTESTINAL WORMS:<\/strong> Also common. Life-threatening in high burdens and young puppies.<br \/>\nWorming every 2 weeks until 3 months old, then monthly until 6 months old, then every 3 months for life.<br \/>\n<strong>HEARTWORM:<\/strong> Least common but most life-threatening. Will cause heart failure and many animals don\u2019t survive the treatment. Requires a yearly injection or in some monthly products.<br \/>\n <strong>FLEAS:<\/strong> Most common parasite in Melbourne.<br \/>\n-Many animals that come to us have fleas- most of the time the owner is unaware.<br \/>\n-Burdens are difficult to eradicate. Each flea can lay up to 300 eggs and each egg can survive for up to 6 months.  Requires a monthly tablet (i.e. Nexgard spectra or Bravecto) or \u201csqueeze- on\u201d (i.e. Advocate or Bravecto). \n<strong>MORE IMPORTANT PUPPY TIPS AND HINTS <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>A) PET INSURANCE<\/strong><br \/>\nWe strongly recommend pet insurance as: 75% of insured owners make a claim within the first 2 years AND 1\/3 of all pets require costly emergency trip each year.<br \/>\n<strong>B) DIET <\/strong><br \/>\nSmall\/medium breeds should be fed puppy food until 12 months of age.<br \/>\nLarger breeds should be fed puppy food until 12-15months of age.<br \/>\nGiant breeds should be fed puppy food until 1.5-2yrs of age. \nWhat should I feed my puppy?<br \/>\nInitially we recommend a fully balanced commercial dry and wet puppy food.<br \/>\nWhen they reach 6-12 months you can offer a variety of foods as long as the daily calorie intake is approximately the same (i.e. reduce the dry food if offering boiled chicken and rice etc). Feed a good quality \u201ccomplete and balanced\u201d puppy dry food. We recommend Royal Canin or Hills Science.<br \/>\nFeed x3 meals per day until your puppy reaches 4 months of age, then reduce to twice daily. \n    \t<strong>DO NOT FEED <\/strong><br \/>\n-Onions and garlic<br \/>\n-Chocolate products<br \/>\n-Coffee products<br \/>\n-Grapes\/raisins<br \/>\n-Sugar free products (gum, ice cream etc)<br \/>\n-Compost items (pips- avocado, stone fruit) and corn cobs etc.<br \/>\n-Fatty food (sausages, pork chops, bbq products)<br \/>\n-Cooked and raw bones<br \/>\n-Raw meat (introduces pathogenic bacteria and parasites into the household).<br \/>\n<strong>DO NOT ALLOW ACCESS TO<\/strong> rat sack, antifreeze, cleaning chemicals, garbage, medications. \n<strong>C) MENTAL + PHYSICAL STIMULATION<\/strong><br \/>\nDogs are high maintenance and they require lots of physical and mental stimulation.<br \/>\n<strong>I) TOYS <\/strong><br \/>\nYour puppy is a born chewer! This behaviour needs to be redirected towards toys.<br \/>\n-Food Toys: Feed entire meals out of food toys, this will enrich your dog&#8217;s environment and help to make him less destructive. We recommend Kong chew toys and Kong Wobblers as providing great entertainment.<br \/>\n-Play Toys: Must be durable with no choking hazards.<br \/>\n-Edible Toys: Vegetable-based chews are safer from bacterial contamination and choking hazards<br \/>\nI.e. Veggie pig\u2019s ears, Greenie\u2019s and Kazoo chews.\u2028<br \/>\n<strong>II) WALKS\/ RUNNING OFF LEAD <\/strong><br \/>\n-Daily walks at walking pace with lots of time to stop and sniff.<br \/>\n-Off lead running is very important as it is the best way to expend energy<br \/>\n<strong>III) PLAY <\/strong><br \/>\n-Always allow plenty of time to play with your puppy.\u2028<br \/>\n-Throwing the ball<br \/>\n-\u201cKibble hunting\u201d- throwing kibble in the grass in the back yard and watching your puppy hunt it down.\u2028<br \/>\n-\u2019Hide + seek\u2019: sit your puppy in one room (may need someone to hold collar) whilst you hide in another room. Then let your puppy use its nose and talent to track you down!\u2028<br \/>\n-Avoid or stop play that creates and over excited state of nipping and biting.<br \/>\n<strong>IV) DESENSITISING <\/strong><br \/>\nGently get your puppy used to having their paws touched, mouth handled, exposure to water and being brushed. Handling your puppy early allows them to enjoy this process. You never know when you&#8217;re gong to have to regularly bath your puppy or brush its teeth!<br \/>\n<strong>V) TRAINING <\/strong><br \/>\n-The best form of mental stimulation.\u2028-Basic tricks such as sit, stay, leave, shake hands can all be started before puppy school &#038; should involve lots of positive reinforcement if your puppy does the right thing. This involves patience- do not get frustrated if your puppy doesn\u2019t sit within 5 minutes.\u2028-Once they have mastered the basics, why not try more exciting training such as \u201cclicker training\u201d. \n<strong>VI) SOCIALISATION <\/strong><br \/>\nPuppies require frequent positive and long term interaction and exposure to greater world experiences in order to become well-rounded adults.<br \/>\nHome and family: Dogs are social animals thus the most important form of socialisation is family.\u2028Puppies should be part of the family and be around the family as much as possible, but must also learn to spend time by themselves.<br \/>\nOther dogs: Early socialisation with friends\u2019 dogs (who are fully vaccinated) is an excellent playdate from the first vaccination. After the second vaccination they can attend puppy school and after the third vaccination can socialise at the local park, be taken on errands around town etc.<br \/>\nCan I take my puppy out before his vaccinations are complete?<br \/>\nIt is vital to have a balanced approach to socialisation and disease prevention by providing your puppy with real-world experiences safely.<br \/>\n-Take your puppy for car rides so he can see, hear and smell the world.\u2028-Take your puppy to friends houses and invite friends to your home to meet the puppy\u2028-Attend a reputable puppy school\u2028-Sit in your driveway or front yard with your puppy so he can watch the world\u2028-Find as many healthy, calm older dogs for your puppy to meet as possible\u2028Positive experiences with dogs, people and objects must continue for the first three years of life.<br \/>\n<strong>D) BASIC TRAINING<\/strong> Before puppy school, there are some behaviours you want to control early<br \/>\n<strong>i) TOILET TRAINING<\/strong> \u2028This can take up to 4 months of age for your puppy to get it right- patience, consistency and lots of praise are key.\u20281. Initially keep your puppy in a confined area that is easy to clean (i.e. laundry, bathroom, kitchen), preferably by the back door. During the day keep your puppy within eyesight as much as possible (if they\u2019re not within eyesight, they can\u2019t be trained).\u20282. Take your puppy out regularly to the grass at least 4-8 times a day, especially 20 min after meals or drinking. 3. When they go to the toilet in the right area give lots of praise and treats.\u20284. When inside, watch for suspicious sniffing in corners &#8211; take them quickly outside.\u20285. If your puppy does toilet inside, only provide corrective reinforcement if you catch them in the act, this involves a loud clap of the hands and a deep-voiced \u201cNO\u201d whilst they are squatting, followed by quick transition outdoors so your puppy understands this is where they are supposed to go.\u20286. If you are too late and see your puppy walking away from their \u201cbusiness\u201d, just clean it up and continue to monitor. DON\u2019T scold your puppy or rub their noses in it, they won\u2019t understand why they are being punished.<br \/>\n<strong>ii) MOUTHING <\/strong><br \/>\nYour puppy lacks impulse control and can easily become carried away with play by mouthing\/biting your hands. Puppies explore their world through their mouths.\u20281. Deter this behaviour as early as possible by limiting activity that encourages mouthing- i.e. roughhousing your puppy using your hands. This is especially important with children.<br \/>\n2. Make sure you play with a toy so they learn to grab the toy and not human skin.\u20283. If your puppy does mouth or bites your hands- say \u201cNO\u201d in a firm voice and encourage play with a toy. If your puppy continues to mouth and bites follow the \u201cTeeth = timeout\u201d rule. Place them immediately in a \u201ctimeout\u201d room like the laundry with no toys for 5 minutes until they calm down.\u20284. Be patient and consistent.<br \/>\n<strong>iii) PUPPY SCHOOL\u2028<\/strong>-The most common reason for family\u2019s surrendering their pet dog is bad behaviour.\u2028-Starting puppy school early to start the socialise and training process very important.\u2028-Learning does not finish with puppy school, continue training and socialisation for at least three years with your dog to give him the best chance to thrive. Your puppy\u2019s happiness depends on it.\u2028-We recommend The Kintala Club and doglifetraining.
