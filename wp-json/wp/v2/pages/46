It is spread by mosquitoes so your pet doesn\u2019t need contact with other animals to become infected.

If you don\u2019t use these products or if you are forgetful, the popular yearly Proheart injection that would be a great option.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fleas<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Fleas are the most &#8220;successful&#8221; parasite in Melbourne and the main cause of severe skin allergies in cats and dogs.

Flea products area available from our clinic.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Intestinal Worms<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Worms live in the intestine of your pet.
